# Tier 1 Troubleshooting Playbook

This repository documents my **Tier-1 IT troubleshooting process** using realistic help desk tickets.

Each ticket represents a common issue in help desk or MSP environments and focuses on:
- Asking the right diagnostic questions
- Identifying scope and impact
- Tier-1 appropriate fixes
- Documenting work clearly
- Knowing when to escalate

This project is to show **troubleshooting methodology**, not automation or anything else.

---

## Project Structure

Each markdown file represents a single help desk ticket.

Tickets include:
- User-reported issue
- Priority and impact
- Initial triage
- Step-by-step troubleshooting
- Commands or tools used
- Root cause
- Resolution

Screenshots from a ticketing system are included where appropriate to show real world workflow.
